## What is a platform?

* A set of business and technology building blocks that serve as the foundation for building complementary products and services.
* A set of resources used in common across a product family that are also subject to network effects
* A open standard facilitating third-party participation together with a contractual or reputational governance model
* A business ecosystem that matches buyers with suppliers who transact directly with each other using system resources

* supplyside eco = users proportional 1/cost; strong supplyside economies meant monopolies

### Demand side

* strong market outcomes
* demands = windows, ios/android, alibaba, fb & linkedin
