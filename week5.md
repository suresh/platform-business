### How can Makerbot lead the growth of the personal manufacturing industry?

MakerBot achieved initial success based on the open-source philosophy. Their products relied on open-source software, hardware, and consumables. MakerBot adopted the open platform approach to launch and gain traction. 

For future growth of the firm, MakerBot needs to do the following:
* Focus on MakerBot’s Thingiverse service (http://www.thingiverse.com) and make it the standard for personal manufacturing industry. They need to offer additional services on top of this site like what other startups like Shapeways. They should focus on building robust APIs and integrations to let other entrants build services. MakerBot should look at vertical integration as there seems to be appetite in this market for truly plug-and-play solutions.
* Focus on enterprise customers through targeted opportunities. Industrial designers and product managers are looking for solutions to quickly design and prototype products. MakerBot's offerings play exactly well in this market and should be leveraged. I suggest they should look at partnering with design software firms to build some of these capabilities onto the design workflow itself. Enterprise customers need a combination of services and hardware and would be willing to pay for integrated solutions that solves a real problem. 

### How effective is Makerbot's open innovation strategy, given the rising competition?

As mentioned in the case, Makerbot used an intense, iterative design process where mistakes were made and fixed. This culture led to rapid improvements in products. This was possible through their open innovation strategy.

Another key element was that most common 3D printing method, Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), which was patented by Stratasys, a 3D printer manufacturer targeting the professional market. This industry relied on open-source innovation to get started and cooperation between existing players to make this adopted by enthusiasts and eager tinkerers. 

MakerBot should now think about moving some of the services and products away from open-source architecture to serve new use-cases of the 3D printing technology.

### What is the threat from established players?

Established players like 3D Systems and Stratasys, as well as HP are not a threat to MakerBot. These larger competitors focused on the enterprise market and were offering products and services that were very expensive when compared to MakerBot.

MakerBot is the disrupter in the 3D business with printers that cost less than $2000 and offering a plethora of features and 3rd party extensions. Going by Christensen' disruptive innovations theory, MakerBot is a low-cost competitor that has initially focused on hobbyist market but is now migrating upstream into higher-value market.


### Are makers a big enough market to drive growth and realize the potential of the technology?

Right MakerBot is focused on makers as the early adopters of 3D technology. MakerBot should use this market to improve their products. 

Disruptive technology companies like Facebook, initially focus on a small market with an inexpensive system and refine it over iterations until their products competes with high-value technology companies. It is quiet difficult for premium companies to move downmarket and compete against disrupters.

As per Christopher Mims writing for Quartz, 
> Indeed, side-by-side comparisons of MakerBot’s Replicator and Replicator 2 printers and Stratasys’s cheapest 3D printer, the Mojo, show the Replicator coming out ahead by all measures, despite the fact that the Mojo costs $10,000 and the Replicator is just $2,200.

We have seen this play out in the software market, where PC software makers displaced older Mainframe software makers. Now these PC makers are disrupted by mobile & cloud based disrupters as seen in Intuit case.

### Some of the key points this week for me:

* Platform is a micro-economy and the operator should understand all the key players and their incentives to play. Platform governance & policies decides economic outcomes and there needs to designed.

* Open vs. Closed platform debate has no clear winner. Taking the example of Android vs iOS operating systems, this week's module illustrated the pros and cons of each apprach. Android started as a open platform and Google lost control of it to competitors like Amazon, Samsung & others. They had to revisit this strategy and become more closed in-order to wrestle control back.

* Platform based disrupters are very difficult to compete against. Facebook showed this against MySpace with 3rd party developers who built best of breed apps on top of the platform. MySpace like most traditional firms believed in doing themselves and found it  difficult to compete against Facebook platform.
