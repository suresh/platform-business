# Notes from Week 1 lectures

## What are Platforms

A platform includes:
* A technology layer for creation and exchange of values
* A governance model to specify behavior on the platform

**Goal** of a platform is consummation of a match between providers and consumers. **Subgoal** is creation and consumption of value objects.

## Network Effects
What is network effect -> Metcalfe law. Value of each use of a service/product increases, if it has network effects.
examples:
1. telephone networks
2. Android OS with developer networks.

### Economies of scale on Supply Side
Oil, Railroads, Automobiles
### Economies of scale on Demand Side
Windows OS, Merchant Markets, Mobile OS, Social Networks

### Key Takeaways
1. Differences by platform across regions -> NA & Asia is dominating because of demand side network effects.
2. In network effects, must focus on external than internal factors. scale matters.

## Impact of Networks on Marketing

1. Single messaging in 80s. Segmentation in 90s. Individual Targeting in 00s. Virality/Social Influence in 10s'
2.. Push/Outbound marketing to Pull/inbound servicing
e.g: Warby Parker with social media connection. post pictures of 5 samples.

## Impact of Networks on Finance

1. Valuing assets to valuing interactions for platform business.
2. Platform businesses -> Damodaran valued at $6B for taxi market; Gurley valued at $19B because of market

## Impact of Networks on Supply Chain

1. Airbnb creates supply with no cost. Hilton can't. Incredibly disruptive.
2. RelayRides instead of rental cars. Utilisation has big hit on automobiles demand. 
   95% idle to 90% idle will have serious hit on demand.

## Impact of Networks on Internal Orgs

1. Employeed must see across platform. common data layer.
2. Sony with Walkman product not a platform. iPod platform. no use of internal data for customer interactions.
3. Amazon platform mandate. All team expose data. communicate through API. No other comm channels. API externalisable.

## Impact of Networks on Innovation

1. Third party contributors -> Andreessen (every niche served. you don't decide what the original developers thought of)
2. Facebook vs Myspace -> 2006 to com; 2007 open to developers;
3. Products can innovate only at a certain rate. harnessing external actors can overtake products.
[think] Apple App Store??

## Summary

Network effects - Finance (blockchain), HR (communities), R&D (open source), 
strategy (ecosystem husbandry, long tail), marketing (push to pull), IT (CRM, social interactions), SCM (assets to interactions)
